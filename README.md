Great 🚀 I see now what your notebook is about.
From the code snippet, I can extract:

Dataset: Clean Augmented Anemia Dataset (Kaggle)

Data types: Conjunctiva / Finger_Nails / Palm images

Goal: Build a deep learning model to detect Anemia from medical images

Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib, PIL, kagglehub

Structure: Data loading, augmentation, model training, evaluation

I can now draft a professional README.md for your GitHub repo.

# 🔬 Anemia Detection using Deep Learning

This project develops a **deep learning model** to detect **Anemia** from medical images such as **conjunctiva, fingernails, and palm images**.  
The goal is to provide a **fast, low-cost, and accessible screening tool** that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

## 🧾 Overview
Anemia is one of the most common blood disorders, often caused by iron deficiency.  
Traditional diagnosis requires **blood tests**, which may not be available in low-resource settings.  

This project leverages **Computer Vision + Deep Learning** to analyze simple medical images (eye conjunctiva, fingernails, and palm) and predict whether a patient is **anemic or healthy**.
